                    <p><span class="descriStart">Live chat</span> can be a valuable tool for students looking to enhance
                        their studies. With live chat, students can connect with tutors or classmates in real-time,
                        allowing for instant feedback and collaboration. This can be particularly helpful for those who
                        have questions or are struggling with a particular subject. Additionally, live chat can provide
                        a sense of community and support, which can be beneficial for students who may feel isolated or
                        overwhelmed. Overall, incorporating live chat into one's study routine can help to improve
                        academic performance and increase motivation.</p>

                    <p><span class="descriStart">Examinations</span> can be a useful tool for students to understand
                        their progress and measure their knowledge and skills. Online exams can provide students with
                        instant feedback, allowing them to identify areas where they need to improve and adjust their
                        study methods accordingly. In the context of a website that offers different courses, online
                        exams can help students track their progress and monitor their performance across different
                        subjects. This can be particularly helpful for students who are studying independently or who
                        are pursuing multiple courses simultaneously.</p>

                    <p><span class="descriStart">Competition</span> can be a great way to motivate students and
                        encourage them to take their studies seriously. By offering online exams as part of a
                        competition, students can compete with one another to test their knowledge and skills. This can
                        create a sense of challenge and excitement, pushing students to strive for excellence and
                        achieve their goals. Online exams can be used as a tool to evaluate students' performance and
                        determine the winners of the competition. Additionally, competitions can create a sense of
                        community and engagement among students, fostering a culture of learning and collaboration.</p>

                        instructor was incredibly knowledgeable and articulate. This was the first time I have taken a
                        class in a remote format, and I was delighted with it and look forward to coming back to ONLC
                        for more classes in the future. I loved the fact that even though I was in a class with other
                        people, the actual physical space was private and quiet and very conducive to learning! Thank

                        and provided a wealth of information about the current version, especially since the last

                        format. The instructor was very knowledgable, worked at a good pace, and most importantly, was
                        very good at communicating with all the attendees and ensuring questions were answered. I would
                        definitely recommend ONLC to others and I hope to have the opportunity to attend more training
